# Install published application - Datameer on Azure HDInsight

In this article, you will learn how to install the [Datameer](https://www.datameer.com/) published Hadoop application on Azure HDInsight. Read [Install third-party Hadoop applications](hdinsight-apps-install-applications) for a list of available Independent Software Vendor (ISV) applications, as well as an overview of the HDInsight application platform. For instructions on installing your own application, see [Install custom HDInsight applications](hdinsight-apps-install-custom-applications.md).

## About Datameer

Sitting natively on the powerful Hadoop platform, Datameer extends existing Azure HDInsight capabilities by facilitating quick integration, preparation and analysis of all structured and unstructured data. Datameer makes it easy to ingest and integrate data with more than 70 sources and formats: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. You can directly upload data, or use their unique data links to pull data on demand. Datameerâ€™s self-service functionality and familiar spreadsheet interface reduces the complexity of big data technology and dramatically accelerates time to insight. The spreadsheet interface provides a simple mechanism for entering declarative spreadsheet formulas that are translated to fully optimized Hadoop jobs. If you have BI or Excel skills, you can use Hadoop in the cloud quickly.
