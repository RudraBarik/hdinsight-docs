# Submit Jobs from R Tools for Visual Studio

## Overview

[R Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/) (RTVS) is a free, open-source extension for the Community (free), Professional, and Enterprise editions of both [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), as well as [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691129) or higher. Most of the critical features of RStudio are included in RTVS, with more being added as the tool matures. If there is a missing feature that you'd like included in RTVS, consider filling out the [RTVS survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RTVS1).

RTVS enhances your R workflow by offering tools such as the [R Interactive window](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/rtvs/interactive-repl) (REPL), intellisense (code completion), [plot visualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/rtvs/visualizing-data) through R libraries such as ggplot2 and ggviz, [R code debugging](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/rtvs/debugging), and more.

To get started, [**install R Tools for Visual Studio**](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/rtvs/installation).

When installing the tools for Visual Studio 2017, make sure you select the **R language support**, **Runtime support for R development**, and **Microsoft R Client** options after selecting the *Data science and analytical applications* workload.
